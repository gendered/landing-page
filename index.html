        What does our language say about us? If you examined the English language and saw the over 200 terms used to derogatorily describe a sexually active woman, you would think well, women aren’t supposed to have sex that much. You would also think, because there is no female equivalent for a “sissy” that fear is not an emotion regarded positively for men. Of course, we have a lot more than language to shape our perceptions of the world but language is still a major factor. In her book “Man Made Language,” Dale Spender writes: “Language encodes a culture's preoccupations and its values; it is one of the main means whereby these [values] are transmitted to children and other incomers to the community.” It’s for that reason that feminist resistance to sexism has often involved creating, altering and contesting language.

        I believe that exploring gendered language is important for revealing, understanding and challenging sexism and patriarchy. Those explorations include asking:
        <ul>
          <li>Which words or named phenomenons are specific to a gender?</li>
          <li>What words to describe a gender exist in surplus or in scarcity?</li>
          <li>What gendered experiences are we get to create names for?</li>
          <li>What words have undergone <a href="https://aslstem.cs.washington.edu/topics/view/8079">semantic derogation</a> and/or sexualization?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="mw6">
        The Gendered Project is a library of gendered words. It allows you to explore what words we have for men and women, and what language can tell us about the patriarchy. I created this so we have data to use in our ongoing dialogue about sexism and how it permeates every facet of our daily lives, all the way down to the words we use.
